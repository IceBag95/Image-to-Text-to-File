Project created on PyCharm.

This is the version 1.0.0 of this app.

Prerequisites:
This app requires that you have locally installed Google's Tesseract. 

Usage:
After tesseract's installation, you can extract text from images using this app. 
Currently only Greek and English are supported and during the extraction phase 
both languages are taken into consideration by the app. To extract text from an 
image, first copy the path of the picture you wish. Then paste it in the entry 
and press "Go!" to begin the extraction. When the process is finished the extracted 
text will be presented in the app's window and you will be able to copy it.

In the next version a button will be added for quick copy of the extracted text. 
Also in future versions the "Stop and Create new Word Document" will be enabled,
giving the user the ability to make a Word document containing the extracted text.

The app is and will always be free.

Happy extracting..?? Well i guess that's a valid wish.... :)
